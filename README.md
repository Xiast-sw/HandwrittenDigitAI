# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This project aims to develop a model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify digits between 0 and 9.

## Features

- Dataset: MNIST (28x28 pixel grayscale images)
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (StandardScaler, PCA, LogisticRegression)
- Training: 60,000 training samples
- Testing: Validation with 10,000 test samples
